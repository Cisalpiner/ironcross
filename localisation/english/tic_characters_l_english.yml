LUETTWITZ_DESC:0 "§W Walther von Lüttwitz, §!seasoned Marshal, decorated war hero, and reluctantly, Regent of the German Empire. Hailing from Bodland, Silesia, 2 February 1859, he was born into a family, enjoying a relatively normal childhood. The young adult quickly enrolled in the military academy, fervently educating himself on matters of warfare and strategy for nearly ten years. The man didn't stop there, though; he would continue to attend school at the Kriegsakademie, finishing it in 1890. \n\n Lüttwitz steadily climbed the ranks of the German army, in WW1 leading entire fronts packed with divisions, corps, and armies. He managed to secure logistical victories in myriad battles, participating in the mildly successful Kaiserschlacht. After the June 3 1919 armistice, Lüttwitz would return to Berlin as commander-in-chief under the provisional social-democrat government and leader of the local Freikorps. He was tasked with the suppression of various uprisings. \n\n That is, until in February of 1920, the Treaty of Versailles was finally ratified. Lüttwitz, among other veterans and commanders were infuriated. How could the Great German Empire have succumbed to the despicable communists of the west? Within? Lüttwitz openly defied treaty stipulations, bolstering Freikorps recruitment and hosting parades. Lüttwitz was, and is, a militarist- he enjoyed the luxuries that came with the high command, the prestige that it brought his Fatherland. He wanted all but to see it crash down, so he and his peers devised a plan, the Kapp-Lüttwitz Putsch. This involved Lüttwitz, various members of the DNVP coalition, along with Erich Ludendorff. On 13 March, Lüttwitz' men marched on Berlin and the Reichskanzelei. Wolfgang Kapp would declare himself Reichskanzler, forming a provisional government. All of this chaos would certainly not be met without resistance, though. The Weimar government issued general strikes across the nation to strangle the power of Kapp and Lüttwitz. Kapp folded relatively quickly and resigned, leaving Lüttwitz to take power. \n\n After all that Lüttwitz had gone through, he could not bear to see the cookie crumble as such. His fate would be decided here and now. Lüttwitz declared to Berlin a state of national emergency and initiated a series of arrests in the region, targetting members of leftist parties. The public was enraged by this and within time, the German Civil War broke out. The Ruhr stood as the bastion of communist power and support, whilst the east and Bavaria staunchly supported Lüttwitz' military authority. French volunteers flooded past the Rhenish border to support the proleterians of Germany, but Lüttwitz' called upon innumerable masses of Freikorps to crush the rebellion. Outright fighting died down within months as the Imperialists squashed urban rebellion, but widespread, subtle resistance would remain, lingering on to this very day. \n\n Though Lüttwitz was on paper just a regent, since the 1920s coup he has made little effort to truly reinstate the Kaiser on account of his 'betrayal of the nation' and currently holds absolute power over the government and the people. The Marshal stands amidst the crossroads of the nation once more. Should a serious competitior to his power arise, his position will display its fragility. \n\n §R The fate of Germany hangs in the balance."
